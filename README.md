## 💭 What is this project?
This is a Pathfinder algorithm visualizer. If you're interested in learning more about this I recommend [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding), but basically, there are some algorithms that can be used to find the most optimal path between two nodes. This visualizer allows you to setup some nodes in a grid and build some obstacles, and let the program calculate the most optimal path. It currently supports the [A* Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) and [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm).

## 🧠 Usage
- Select an algorithm from the **Algorithm** menu (A* or Dijkstra)
- Draw `Starting` and `Target` nodes
- Draw `Wall` nodes
- Press **Visualize!**

## 📊 Implemented algorithms
- [A* Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
- [Dijkstra's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
